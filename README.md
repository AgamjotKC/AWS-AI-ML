Flower Species Classification

Overview

This project aims to classify flower species using pretrained deep learning models, including EfficientNet, ResNet50, and VGG16. The classifier can identify the species of a flower from an image and provides detailed classification results.

Features

Image Classification: Utilizes pretrained models (EfficientNet, ResNet50, VGG16) for accurate flower classification.
Image Input: Supports image input in local file format.
Early Stopping: Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting during training.
